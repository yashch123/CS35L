export LC_ALL=‘C’
Used this command to change my system’s locale to C. 

sort /usr/share/dict/words > words
Got the file ‘words’ and sorted its contents

wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
Got a copy of the webpage using the wget command 


Commands: 

1. cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This command separates all the Alphabetic characters i.e. A-Z and a-z from all the other characters. Thus, it replaces all the characters that are not alphabets with new lines. 

2. cat assign2.html | tr -cs ‘A-Za-z’ ‘[\n*]’
This command replaces each continuous group of non alphabetic characters with a new line. 
Difference in output: No empty lines displayed. 

3. cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort > output3.txt
All words are sorted in alphabetical order. Each word has a new line. 

4. cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u > output3.txt
Sorts all the words alphabetically but displays each word only once. 

5. cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words > output3.txt
Outputs 3 columns: 
1st column: Words unique to assign2.txt
2nd column: Words unique to words
3rd column: Words common to both the files. 

6. cat assign2.txt | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words > output3.txt
Only outputs words that are unique to assign2.txt (the HTML page).


After this, I used wget to get the copy of the Hawaiian to English words page. 
wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm


cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l 


Spell Checker
—————————————————————

We first need to get all the Hawaiian words into ‘hwords’. Running build words on our assignment page does the job. 
cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords 

Essentially how these spelling checkers are working is: They compare and check for words in the files ‘words’ and ‘hwords’, and words that are not there in the webpage. 

Thus, If there is a word in ‘hwords’ and not in the webpage then it is misspelled in Hawaiian.

Similarly if there is a word in ‘words’ and not there in the webpage, it is misspelled in English. 

First we use the spell checker on ‘hwords’ itself: 
cat hwords | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l 

As expected we find that there are no such words which are misspelled in the ‘hwords’ dictionary itself. 

On the webpage: 

Hawaiian words that are misspelled: 
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| sort -u | comm -23 - hwords 

We will count the number of words using the wc -l command. 

Number of misspelled English words: 39 words
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| sort -u | comm -23 - words | wc -l

Number of misspelled Hawaiian words: 409 words
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'| sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l 

Words misspelled as English but not as Hawaiian: halau and wiki 
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words | comm -12 - hwords

The comm -23 words gives us the misspelled English words, whereas the comm -12 hwords gives us the words right in Hawaiian. 

Words misspelled in Hawaiian but not in English: attempt,cat,input etc. 
cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | comm -12 - words

Using the wc -l option we find that there are 372 such words.
