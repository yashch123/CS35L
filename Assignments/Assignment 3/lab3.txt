First did wget for the assignment page and then did wget for the
coreutils link:

1. To get the file:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

To unzip file:
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. 

Go into INSTALL and read about —prefix. 
To install file: 

cd coreutils-7.6
./configure —prefix=“/u/cs/ugrad/yashc/coreutilsInstall”
make
make install
make installcheck 

3. By going into the src directory to the unmodified coreutils-7.6.
Making sure we have the 'en_US.UTF-8' locale.

cd coreutilsInstall
cd bin
./ls -l 

Here we get the wrong format of the date. 

Note that we are using ./ls instead of ls because we downloaded the
earlier version of ls and have to use it as an executable to mirror
the error; the recent versions of ls are all fixed.

4.  To fix this bug I copy and paste the Brady’s patch into a file
called patch_file.

cd coreutils-7.6
emacs patch_file 
and paste the Brady’s patch in there

5.

patch -p1 < patch_file make Only ls.c was modified hence the number of
files displayed was less during make this time.  We only recompiled
the files that had been modified.

6.

cd coreutils-7.6/src
./ls -l /bin/bash

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 Dec 22  2015 /bin/bash

This time we see that the format was as we wanted. 

If we go into coreutilsInstall/bin

cd coreutilsInstall/bin
./ls -l 

As expected we get the wrong format for the date.

We use the make command for the patch and that modifies the src in the
coreutils-7.6 directory and thus the ls here is fixed. But, the ls
executable in coreutilsInstall is still not fixed hence the wrong
format is still shown there.


Now creating our own files and creating a file made more than an year ago.

We create these files in coreutils-7.6/src:

touch file1
touch -t 201202020202 file2

Then doing ./ls -l  we get:

-rw-r--r-- 1 yashc csugrad      0 Oct 14 19:53 file1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yashc csugrad      0 Feb  2  2012 file2

We see that when the file is at least a year old, the ls shows the
year along with the date and month. Whereas for a recent file we only
see the time,date and month.

The difference in the outputs are: 

Fixed ./ls -l in coreutils-7.6/src:
-rw-r--r-- 1 yashc csugrad      0 Oct 14 19:53 file1

Broken ./ls -l in coreutilsInstall/bin: 
-rw-r--r-- 1 yashc csugrad      0 2016-10-14 19:53 file1
