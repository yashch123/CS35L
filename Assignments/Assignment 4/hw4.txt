I start off the homework by checking out v3.0 in a new branch called "quote"
cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.
 To make sure I'm in the right branch I do
git branch
which shows me *quote thus showing I'm in the quote branch.

To apply our patch into this branch we do:
patch -p1 < ./quote-3.0-patch.txt

5.  We do git status to check that there are 6 .c files that are
modified.  I manually go thorugh each file and change the log of each
file using C-x 4 a.

emacs ChangeLog to see the logs you've written in each file.

6.
To commit my changes:
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

7.
Then to make a formt patch we use:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.
For this part Ben Spector was my Lab Partner.

I made a new temp directory tempgit, then:
git checkout v3.0 -b partner

After sharing the files I got his file into my server and then applied git am command to it
git am git am ~/garvit/formatted-patch_garvit.txt
After which it showed:
git am ~/garvit/formatted-patch_garvit.txt

I checked git log to see the commit added by Garvit:

        * diff.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes ' for every line except for comments.
    
        * diff3.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes ' for every line except for comments for the version 3.0.
    
        * util.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes '.
    
        * dir.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes ' for every string literal.
    
        * sdiff.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes ' for every string literal or command.
    
        * cmp.c: Changed the grave accent ` to apostrophes ' for every line except for comments.

Now to bootstrap and checking it it works with make check
To get help2man, I export the path.

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

Now to make sure that it worked we do:
src/diff - .
and get the right format as we expect: “diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory”

9.  To ensure that the ChangeLog also works we run the command: make distsir
This creates a new directory inside our diffutils namely
diffutils-3.0.1-5a55
cd diffutils-3.0.1-5a55
Inside diffutils-3.0.1-5a55 we have a file ChangeLogs.  Opening that file we
see my partners commit along with the message and timestamp.

Since I have a macbook I use X11 to look at gitk and the page.
