Description:
I used X11 to use the gitk command on my macbook.

The window is divided into multiple sections.
The top left shows the branching of the repository neatly along with all the commit messages. We can also see the HEAD pointer. (master)

Also, in the middle we see the list of name and email addresses of all the people who have committed to the repository.

On the right we see the dates along with the time when all the files were committed. 

On the bottom we see the parent,child,branches,committer and commit message about the selected commit.
