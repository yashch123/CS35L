In this we measure the differences in performance between sfrob, sfrobu and sfrobs. 
Performance here includes the time taken by the program to generate the desier output, the number of comparisons etc. 

We use the programs over inputs of varying lengths:

10 line file:

time ./sfrob < test.txt
real   0m0.002s
user   0m0.000s
sys    0m0.002s

time ./sfrobu < test.txt 
real 0m0.002s
user 0m0.001s
sys  0m0.001s

time ./sfrobs < test.txt
real 0m0.007s
user 0m0.005s
sys  0m0.001s


100 file line:

time ./sfrob < lab.txt
real 0m0.003s

sys  0m0.000s

time ./sfrobu < lab.txt
real 0m0.007s
user 0m0.000s
sys  0m0.006s

time ./sfrobs < lab.txt
real 0m0.006s
user 0m0.004s
sys  0m0.003s

100000 line file:
time ./sfrob < big.txt
real   0m2.353s
user   0m1.209s
sys    0m0.168s

time ./sfrobu < big.txt
real	    0m9.002s
user	    0m1.116s
sys	    0m7.876s

time ./sfrobs < big.txt


Differences between sfrobu and sfrob:
 We notice that the time taken by
sfrob and sfrobu is almost similar. The sys times are lesser for sfrob
indicating that there are much lesser syscalls from sfrob. Apart from
this we notice that the number of comparisons for both sfrob and
sfrobu are exactly similar. Thus both work in a similar manner except
the fact that sfrob calls lesesr number of syscalls.

sfrobs comparison: For sfrobs we notice that it takes relatively more
time than both sfrob and sfrobu.  Thus, altogether its a much more
expensive procedure to call sfrobs than sfrob or sfrobu.  The reasons
may vary from sicne its a shell script, it takes more time to operate,
much more syscalls, pipelining. 

 Looking at the nummber of comparisons
against number of lines we see:

1 line: 17 comparisons
10 line: 400 comparisons
100 line: 2696 comparisons
1000 line: 45564 comparisons
100000: 18670742 comparisons

Using Linear Regression tools on this data 
we see that there is an almost linear relationship between
the comparisons and number of lines of text. 
The slope being approximately 20 
Thus, we can approximate a linear function that relates
comparisons and number of lines.
